# How to use Kantan Reader

## Searching Manga
Use the small box in the top left to search manga by title.

A list of titles will appear - click your desired title. Now, you can navigate by volume, and then by chapter. Chapters not yet released will appear at the bottom, in a special entry called 'Latest Chapters.'

Clicking a chapter loads it into the reader.

Click the 'toggle search' button in the top left to make the search/navigation tool appear and disappear.

## Reading Manga
You can turn the page backwards or forwards in a chapter by clicking on the left or right side of the loaded manga image, respectively.

Using the left and right arrow keys provides the same functionality.

Clicking on the 'progress bar' will jump to a particular page in that chapter.

If you're reading on mobile and run into a two page spread, I recommend turning your phone - the image will resize.

If you try to navigate past the first or last page of a chapter, Kantan Reader will try to load the next chapter in the same volume for you.

If there are no more chapters in a volume, Kantan Reader will show an alert saying there are no more chapters. At this point, you can click on the toggle search button and navigate to a new volume.

- Please note that sometimes images may load slowly, due to your connection or mangadex's. Navigating to a new page will load a new image - please be patient.
